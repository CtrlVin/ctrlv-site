            <h1>CtrlV<span class="green">.in</span> is no more.</h1>

            <p>CtrlV launched in 2009 to solve a problem that existed at the time - a way to easily share images without all the hassle of uploading them. Since then technology has improved and most services allow you to paste images directly to them (e.g. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp). CtrlV is no longer needed.</p>

            <p>A good alternative image host is <a href="https://imgur.com/" target="_blank" class="green">imgur</a>, which provides the same functionality CtrlV did.</p>

            <p>All images that were uploaded will be securely deleted.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions or would like to know about any future projects you can <a href="https://twitter.com/nthonyk" target="_blank" class="green">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
